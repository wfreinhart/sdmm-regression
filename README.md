# sdmm-regression

Python codes used to generate data in "Predicting aggregate morphology of sequence-defined macromolecules with Recurrent Neural Networks" (DOI TBD).
Data files and pretrained models can be obtained from Zenodo [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6585654) (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6585654).
The code is provided as-is at time of publication.
Almost nothing is optimized and documentation is barebones.

Feel free to contact reinhart@psu.edu with questions.
We will update in the future if anyone finds this of interest.
